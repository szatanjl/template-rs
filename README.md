Rust Project Template
=====================

This is a template for Rust project.
Use it as a starting point to quickly set up your own project with
a standardized structure, build process, and development workflow.

To begin:

1. Change `project_name` in Cargo.toml, Makefile, .dockerignore,
   and .gitignore
2. Configure repository files in .github/ directory
3. Update Cargo.toml
4. Update LICENSE and all mentions of it (`grep LICENSE`)
5. Update contact information and email addresses (`grep @example.com`)
6. Edit this README and replace all `<...>` placeholders
7. Start your project

Note: Project name must only contain ASCII lowercase letters, digits,
periods, and hyphens.  It must start with a letter, must not end with
a period nor hyphen, and must not contain two adjacent periods nor
hyphens.

Regex: `[a-z]([-.]?[0-9a-z]+)*`

Rationale: This is the most portable naming convention that is also
human and machine friendly.

- It is compatible with most character sets and encodings:
  ASCII, Unicode, UTF-8, base64-url
- It is case-insensitive
- It can be used as a filename on most filesystems
  It is compatible with POSIX portable filename character set
- It is URL-safe
- It is compatible with docker image naming convention
- It is compatible with make, shell, markdown, and other programming
  and markup languages.  No spaces, or any special characters which
  could be problematic to handle
- It can be used as an identifier in programming languages.
  May only require changing a hyphen ('-') to an underscore ('\_')
